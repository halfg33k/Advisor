Academic Advisor
=========

This is the repository for the Academic Advisor project for CMSC 355. Here, we will collaborate to complete a simple program that could be used for academic advising.

The requirements are as follows:

1. Manage student information: The faculty is able to use the software to create students information. For each student, the student’s name, user ID, and grade (freshman, sophomore, junior or senior) must be provided.  The software should allow the user to import a text file that contains a list of students’ information, or to enter this information for each student via the keyboard.  The user should be able to import a list of additional students and/or add, delete, or edit student information at any time.  Deleting a student for whom academic advising or graduation information has been entered must require user confirmation.

2. Record academic advising:  Once the student finishes the academic advising with the faculty, the faculty is able to mark the student’s academic advising is done. 

3. Record graduation submission: If a student submitted the graduation application at the last semester, the faculty is able to type in the total GPA, major GPA, major credits, upper level credits, and the total credits information that the student will earn till the graduation. 
  1. Besides above, the faculty is able to check if the student meets the graduation requirement. (Total GPA and major GPA are grater than or equal 2.0, major credits and upper level credits are >= 45, and the total credits are >= 120). If the student does not meet the requirement, the student should be marked with unqualified reason. If the student meets the graduation requirement, the student will be marked with “qualified for graduation”.

4. View report: the faculty should be able to view the following reports:
  1. Student academic advising report:  The faculty should be able to select one or more students, or all students, and view complete academic advising reports for the selected students.  Please check Appendix A for the information that should be presented in the report. 
  2. Graduation application report:  This report lists all of the students who submitted the graduation application. Please check Appendix B for the information that should be presented in the report. 
    1. There will be two types of graduation application reports. One report is for the students qualified for graduation. The other one lists all the students who are not qualify for graduation. Please check Appendix C for the presented information.
